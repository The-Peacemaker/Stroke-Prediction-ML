## Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a person experiencing a stroke based on health parameters such as age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and more.

Strokes are among the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and preventive care.
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to classify whether a person is likely to suffer a stroke or not using publicly available data.
